## Prospective Students

I typically recruit motivated PhD and Master students each year who are passionate about transportation system optimization, network resilience, smart mobility, and related fields.

**Ideal candidates should possess:**

* A strong mathematical background (Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization Theory)
* Solid programming skills (Proficiency in Python is preferred)
* Intense curiosity, self-motivation, and a collaborative spirit

If you are interested in my research areas and meet the basic requirements, **please feel free to contact me via email** ([Your Email Address]). Include your **CV**, **transcripts**, and a **brief personal statement** outlining your research interests and why you are interested in joining our lab.

Due to the volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to all inquiries, but I will carefully review every application. I look forward to exploring the future of transportation with outstanding students like you!
