My research focuses on leveraging system science, operations research, and artificial intelligence to understand, model, optimize, and enhance the performance and resilience of modern transportation systems. We are dedicated to tackling challenging theoretical problems and exploring their real-world application value.

Below are the key research themes we are currently focusing on:

## <a name="electric-mobility"></a> 1. Electric Mobility Systems

* **Core Question**: How to efficiently and economically plan and operate the growing fleets of electric vehicles (buses, taxis, logistics)?
* **Research Topics**:
    * Electric bus network optimization and scheduling
    * Location and layout optimization for charging infrastructure (fixed and mobile)
    * Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) potential assessment and dispatch strategies
    * Electric vehicle user behavior modeling and charging guidance

## <a name="urban-commuting"></a> 2. Urban Commuting Systems

* **Core Question**: How to alleviate urban commuting congestion and improve commuting efficiency and experience?
* **Research Topics**:
    * Multi-modal commuting network modeling and analysis
    * Simulation and evaluation of travel demand management strategies (e.g., congestion pricing, flexible work schedules)
    * Integration and optimization of shared mobility (ride-sharing, bike-sharing) with public transport
    * Mining commuting behavior patterns based on big data

## <a name="resilience"></a> 3. Transportation System Resilience & Reliability

* **Core Question**: How to design and manage transportation systems to effectively withstand, adapt to, and rapidly recover from various disruptions (e.g., extreme weather, accidents, attacks)?
* **Research Topics**:
    * Transportation network vulnerability identification and cascading failure analysis
    * Resilience assessment methods based on agent-based simulation
    * Emergency evacuation and rescue routing optimization
    * Resilience enhancement strategies in intelligent connected vehicle environments (current focus of an international collaboration project)

## <a name="multi-modal-mobility"></a> 4. Future Multi-Modal Mobility

* **Core Question**: How to integrate emerging transportation modes (e.g., autonomous driving, low-altitude aircraft) to build seamless, efficient, and sustainable future urban mobility systems?
* **Research Topics**:
    * Integrated planning and operational simulation of low-altitude economy and ground transportation networks
    * Autonomous vehicle fleet dispatching and management
    * Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platform design and optimization
    * Application of Artificial Intelligence (especially Large Language Models, LLMs) in traffic demand forecasting and management
