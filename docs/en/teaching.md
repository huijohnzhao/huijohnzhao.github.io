## Teaching Philosophy

I believe that the best learning happens through doing. My teaching aims to connect abstract theories with vivid case studies, guiding students not just to "learn" knowledge, but to "apply" it to analyze and solve real-world problems. I encourage classroom interaction, critical thinking, and attempts to put learning into practice.
