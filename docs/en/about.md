## Research Philosophy & Interests

I believe that the integration of system science perspectives, the rigor of operations research, and the cutting-edge power of artificial intelligence can provide profound insights and innovative solutions to the complex challenges facing modern transportation systems.

My research strives to strike a balance between theoretical depth and practical application, aiming to push the boundaries of efficiency, equity, safety, and resilience in transportation. I am particularly interested in the opportunities and challenges brought by emerging technologies such as electrification, automation, and connectivity.

Currently, my core research interests include (but are not limited to):
* [Planning and Operation of Electric Mobility Systems](research.md#electric-mobility)
* [Management and Strategies for Urban Commuting Systems](research.md#urban-commuting)
* [Transportation System Resilience and Reliability](research.md#resilience)
* [Future Multi-Modal Mobility Services (Integrating the Low-Altitude Economy)](research.md#multi-modal-mobility)

I welcome communication and collaboration with peers and prospective students interested in related fields.
